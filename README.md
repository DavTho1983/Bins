A word of explanation to the employer:

I had not used pivot very much before and I had to ask somebody how to do it, but now I know, I feel confident I can use the syntax again. I have an interview tomorrow with somebody offering me a very similar role for the same money and they are happy for me to learn as I go, which is really what I'm looking for - although if you can offer me the same I would be happy to hear from you. Someone has pointed out to me that the ical format means I can use an alternative method, but I went for pandas because I know it quite well and it is very powerful when used in conjunction with databases and django. Pandas also has some stuff that removes the need for loops, which makes things much faster, especially with large files.

This took me about 1 and a half hrs considering I had to ask about pivots - after that it was pretty simple.

The unittest code and comparing the time data were all my own work tho.

The Datestamps are all the same?
